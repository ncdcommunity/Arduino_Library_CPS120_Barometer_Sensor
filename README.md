How to Use the CPS120 Arduino Library

The CPS120 is very easy to interface with arduino.

1.Address calling:The following command is used to call the address of CPS120 to start the transmission.

           cps.getAddr_CPS120(CPS120_DEFAULT_ADDRESS);   // 0x28
           
2.Pressure measurement:The following command is used to measure the pressure.           
           
           cps.Measure_Pressure();
           
3.Temperature measurement:The following command is used to measure the temperature.
           
           cps.Measure_Temperature();
